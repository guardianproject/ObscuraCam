QuickActions
------------

"The QuickActions dialog is not included in standard Android SDK, so we have
to create it manually. At first, i had no idea on how to create it so i
decided to download and read the Contact app source code from Android git. I
found that the QuickContact dialog uses private API call
(com.android.internal.policy.PolicyManager) that does not exists in standard
SDK. After posting question about it on google groups and stack overflow, i
got the solution for it from Qberticus (thanx Qberticus!)."
