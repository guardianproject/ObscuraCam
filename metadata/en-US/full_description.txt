In a world of viral videos and facial recognition, ObscuraCam helps you share photos and videos while protecting the privacy of you and those you care about. With ObscuraCam you can blur and disguise faces in your photos and videos. Information that could identify you as the cameraperson is removed from the files for added security

★ PRIVACY FOR YOUR PICTURES: ObscuraCam can be used as a camera to take photos, or to anonymize photos and videos you’ve already taken
★ DISGUISE YOURSELF: Cover faces with pixelate, redact (blackout) or funny nose and glasses
★ AUTOMATIC FACE DETECTION: ObscuraCam automatically detects faces in both photos and videos, so you can quickly and easily anonymize a crowd or a long video
★ MULTIPLE PRIVACY MODES: Faces can be pixelated, removed completely, or disguised with funny nose and glasses. You can also blur everything except a small portion of an image
★ SHARE SECURELY: We remove all identifying data stored in photos including GPS location data and phone make & model so you can save the protected photo back to the Gallery, or share it directly to Facebook, Twitter or any other "Share" enabled app
★ PROTECTS THE IDENTITY OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER: Smartphones attach information to every photo they take, including where it was taken and by what type of camera. ObscuraCam removes all of this information
★ AWARD-WINNING: ObscuraCam was a Winner of the 2013 Knight News Challenge
